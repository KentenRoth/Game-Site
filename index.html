						Dungeon Island is a small game that runs in the
						terminal. It is a text-based game, with different areas
						and enemies. You can move to new areas, attack enemies,
						drink health potions, and as you progress and take
						enemies out, you will level up. There are three
						different classes of characters that you can be, and
						each has its benefits and drawbacks. The Ninja has a
						lower HP, and does not block well, but has a higher
						dodge chance and potential to hit for double damage. The
						warrior is the middle ground with the chance to block
						and absorb damage, and It is also in the middle for the
						amount of HP that it has. The Viking has the most HP,
						and the best block ability, but a low dodge chance.

						<p>
							After several conversations with recruiters and
							people in the industry, I have seen a lot of
							feedback pointing towards me needing to learn Node
							and OOP. So I decided that one way I could tackle
							both of these things at the same time would be to
							build out a small game. This would allow me to learn
							how to learn OOP while building on my JS and
							learning the new things that Node brings to the
							table. I enjoyed the process of doing this. I ran
							into many obstacles, but the best part about coding
							is the feeling once you overcome the roadblocks in
							your code.
